# Puter Documentation

Hi, you've found Puter's wiki page on GitHub! If you were looking for
something else, you might find it in the links below.
All of the wiki docs are generated from `doc/` directories in the main
repository, so it's best to edit docs there rather than here.

## Users

our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/PQcx7Teh8u) and
[subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/puter/) are good places
